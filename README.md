## Introduction </br>
The dataset that I'll be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "[they're good dogs Brent.](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent)" WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

In this project, I'll wrangle `WeRateDogs` Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. I will then make `additional gathering`, then `assessing` and `cleaning` which is required for **"Wow!"**-worthy analyses and visualizations. </br>
The project document which communicates all the insights and displays the visualizations I produced from the data I wrangled is the [act_report.pdf]()
